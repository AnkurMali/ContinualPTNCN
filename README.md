# PTNCN-Local-recurrent-and-parallel-predictive-coding
We introduce Local recurrent Predictive coding model termed as Parallel temporal Neural Coding Network. Unlike classical RNNs, our model is pure local and doesn't require computing gradients backward in time; thus computationally more efficient compared to BPTT and can be used for online learning
