# ContPTNCN
This sub-directory contains material in support of the IEEE TNNLS model, i.e., PTNCN/Parallel Temporal PC.
Specifically, it contains code to train and run a P-TNCN (with 2 latent variable layers) on discrete
token data sequences, i.e., sequences which contain character symbol or word/subword symbol tokens.
