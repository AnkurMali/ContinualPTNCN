# ContPTNCN
Rough draft of IEEE TNNLS repo for PTNCN (do not share w/ public).
Shared to play with the code, official library is coming in September 

Contains code to train and run a P-TNCN (with 2 latent variable layers) on discrete
token data, i.e., character symbol or word/subword symbol tokens.
